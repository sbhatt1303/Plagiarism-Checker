Architecture -

The Plagiarism Checker consists of three Python scripts and one Bash script - PlagiarismChecker.py, average.py, OutputErase.py, Run.sh
average.py and OutputErase.py are helper scripts used to take the average over some 100 runs and clear the output files respectively.
PlagiarismChecker.py is the primary script, and is used to run the actual application.
Run.sh is a bash script that runs all the above 3 scripts and the outputs the percentage of similarity between the given documents.


Data Structures Used -

The majorly used data structures are:
Lists - can be considered linear, random access arrays, used for general purpose storage.
Dictionaries - these are implemented in Python as Hash Maps, and so offer fast searching and mapping of information, and hence were very useful in the project.


Distance Measures Used -

Euclidean Distance
Cosine Distance
